-- P, P → Q∨R, Q → S, R → S  ⊢  not (not S)
-- Four nested scopes. `or` is used as a contradiction trigger, not a case split.

Let t be an entity.
Let P, Q, R, S be sets.

Assume (p):   t in P.
Assume (pqr): if t in P then t in Q or t in R.
Assume (qs):  if t in Q then t in S.
Assume (rs):  if t in R then t in S.

Suppose (ns): not (t in S) {

    Suppose (q): t in Q {
        By rule (qs), it follows that t in S as (s1).
        Absurd from (s1), (ns).
    }
    Hence (nq): not (t in Q).

    Suppose (r): t in R {
        By rule (rs), it follows that t in S as (s2).
        Absurd from (s2), (ns).
    }
    Hence (nr): not (t in R).

    By rule (pqr), it follows that t in Q or t in R as (qr).
    Absurd from (qr), (nq), (nr).
}
Hence (nns): not (not (t in S)).

Therefore not (not (t in S)).
Why not (not (t in S)).
